Schedulers are used to perform tasks asynchronously.
	--> immediate : default --> running on a signle thread on a main thread
	--> parallel --> perform different tasks on different threads, heavy competition to perform.
 	--> single
	--> boundedelastic



parallel(): Optimized for fast Runnable non-blocking executions
single(): Optimized for low-latency Runnable one-off executions
elastic(): Optimized for longer executions, an alternative for blocking tasks where the number of active tasks (and threads) can grow indefinitely
boundedElastic(): Optimized for longer executions, an alternative for blocking tasks where the number of active tasks (and threads) is capped
immediate(): to immediately run submitted Runnable instead of scheduling them (somewhat of a no-op or "null object" Scheduler)
