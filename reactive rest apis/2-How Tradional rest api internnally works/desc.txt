In spring app, we have an embeded tomcat server
for each request we create a thread, it will communicate with db , it will do nothing while waiting for db to respond, when the db
responds he returns the data and the thread is free.

BY DEFAULT WE CAN REACH 200 THREADS AT A TIME ANY REQUEST THAT COMES AFTER WILL WAIT UNTIL A  THREAD IS FREE TO BE CREATED UNTILL THEN EVERY 
REQUEST IS BLOCKED? EACH THREAD CAN COST 1MB --> 200 AT TOP WITH 200 THREADS

TO INCREASE MAX THREADS --> PROPERTY : server.tomcat.threads.max=number (200 default = max) --> out of memory error

--> to counter this problem we can use mltiple instances runnnig along with a load balancer
