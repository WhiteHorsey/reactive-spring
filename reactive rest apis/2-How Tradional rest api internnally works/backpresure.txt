we ha have a water faucet (source of data) and a bucket (receiver) , the receiver has full controll of the flow of the data comming
from the source we can slow down the speed or increase or stop it completely.

/////////////////// REAL WORLD EXAMPLE ///////////////////

spring boot -------- findAll() --------> database.

for example spring boot app is not able to handle the amount of incoming data (out of ressources).
there is no way spring can say : hey can you slown down i am out of resources, give me some time, and you (source) slown down
and i will try to rearenge the ressources.







------------------------->  CHALLEGNGES:

1- Synchronous and blocking
2- thread per request model. (handle lot of request at the same time).
3- Not supporting bakc pressure.
